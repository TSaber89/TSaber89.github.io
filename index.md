## Slide 3

The first part of this assignment requires a shiny application with associated 
supporting documentation. 

The application was deployed to Rstudio's shiny server

The server.r and ui.r code was shared on github

The application includes the following:

 - Input consists of a slider that will adjust the size of the bins.  

- The application builds a histogram based on the accumulation of the magnitude
  of the quakes.

## Slide 4

The Fiji quakes dataset was used for this project.
It is a simple data collection recording the 
earthquakes in Fiji and their magnitude.  

The next slide is a copy of the applications output.
It simply results in a histogram based on the size of the bins.
